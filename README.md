# Relief-Tracking 


Relief  Tracking 

What happens after money/items are donated to relief victims.
Is there a way to track/make it transparent to help more people to contribute .

Are there any existing NGO website which does this ? If not, let's build a community site.

Ver1. 
1.List of valid and invalid sites that are collecting money in the name of relief. 
		(The list will be updated everyday at 12am, this lists need to validated manually from a contributor)
		Initially maintained at a FB public page, can later be done a standalone website .
2. People who donated money/items can make entry at this link 	(https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MJJSLWR)

Ver2.
1. Build a search based functionality to check for available sites .
